# THSR-Ticket Rust

A program for booking ticket of Taiwan High Speed Railway (THSR).

This is the rust version of the original python ver [THSR-Ticket](https://github.com/BreezeWhite/THSR-Ticket), with improvements including more CLI input options, early-bird support, membership, etc.

## Install
### Download from the [Release](https://github.com/BreezeWhite/thsr-ticket-rs/releases) page

Pick the one according to your OS, download the executable file, and open the terminal to execute it.

You could also put it to one of your PATH dir (e.g. ~/.local/bin for Ubuntu) to always make it accessable.

### Install with cargo

Make sure you have [cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html) installed.

For older linux machines, this method is preferred, since the release is built by Github Action and the workflow only supports Ubuntu-22.04 and latter.
